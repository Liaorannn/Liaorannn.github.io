<h2>About</h2>

<p>
Hey 👋, I’m Aoran Li!
</p>

<p>
    Welcome to my personal website!
</p>

<p>
    I am currently a graduate student in Financial Mathematics at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
  Prior to this, I studied at the CUFE majoring in both Mathematics and Finance.
</p>

<p>
    As a quant enthusiast, I possess a comprehensive understanding of both p-quant and q-quant fields.
  My skills set include data preprocessing, visualization, ML & DL & RL modeling, PDE and Monte carlo simulations.
  I am familiar with multi-factors investment, quantitative modeling and structured derivatives pricing.
  I possess a general understanding in various fields, yet I lack in-depth knowledge in a particular area.
</p>

<p>
    My career goal is to utilize ML and DL techniques in the realm of financial derivatives.
  I am dedicated to ongoing learning and self-improvement within this field.
  This blog serves as a personal platform for me to document my work, studies, and life experiences.
</p>

<p>
    Here, I share my thoughts and experiences on various topics that interest me. Join me on this journey of exploration and discovery as we delve into the world of creativity, self-improvement, and beyond.
</p>
       
<p>
    Thank you for visiting, and hope you enjoy your stay !
