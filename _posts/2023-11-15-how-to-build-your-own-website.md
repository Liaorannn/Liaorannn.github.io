This is my inaugural blog post following the completion of my personal website's construction. After nearly four days of strenuous effort, I have successfully finished building my website, which is showcased here. Despite the abundance of tutorials available that guide users on utilizing GitHub Pages and Jekyll to construct a blog website, this process can still be quite intricate and laborious, particularly for those unfamiliar with the HTML language.

Consequently, I have resolved to pen this blog post to chronicle my four-day "ordeal" and also to facilitate others in effortlessly constructing their own websites. As I am not an adept writer, I will merely elucidate some crucial points in this article and share some beneficial tutorials below that played a pivotal role in my construction process.

## Prerequisite

Assuming you are a beginner or novice looking to take learning or course notes using a computer, the initial challenge you will encounter is selecting an appropriate platform. There are several excellent knowledge-sharing platforms available, such as Stack Overflow, Zhihu, Jianshu, CNBlogs (博客园), CSDN, and FeiShu. While creating your own personal blog can be an exciting endeavor, allowing for customization and self-expression, it is essential to consider the time and cost involved in this process. Therefore, make sure that you have a genuine desire to pursue this option.

Below is some **prerequisite** for your blog construction:
- Markdown knowledge
- Little or No HTML knowledge + chatgpt
- Notes-taking software: vscode, typora, notion or obsidian(my choice)
 - Git and Github knowledge

## Building Blog Repo

Once you have your github, you can create your blog repo named `{your-github-name}.github.io`. For a detailed explanation of the steps and the flow, you can refer to the tutorial link below.
